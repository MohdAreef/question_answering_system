Power of court to make section 8 orders
In any family proceedings in which a question arises with respect to the welfare of
any child, the court may make a section 8 order with respect to the child if—
(a) an application for the order has been made by a person who—
(i) is entitled to apply for a section 8 order with respect to the child; or
(ii) has obtained the leave of the court to make the application; or
(b) the court considers that the order should be made even though no such
application has been made.
The court may also make a section 8 order with respect to any child on the application
of a person who—

(b) has obtained the leave of the court to make the application.
This section is subject to the restrictions imposed by section 9.

consent of that authority; or
(iii) in any other case, has the consent of each of those (if any) who have
parental responsibility for the child.
A person who would not otherwise be entitled (under the previous provisions of this

to apply for any such section 8 order as may be prescribed in relation to that category

child concerned, the court may only grant leave if it is satisfied that he has sufficient
understanding to make the proposed application for the section 8 order.

the child concerned, the court shall, in deciding whether or not to grant leave, have
particular regard to—
(a) the nature of the proposed application for the section 8 order;
(b) the applicant’s connection with the child;
(c) any risk there might be of that proposed application disrupting the child’s life
to such an extent that he would be harmed by it; and
(d) where the child is being looked after by a local authority—
(i) the authority’s plans for the child’s future; and
(ii) the wishes and feelings of the child’s parents.
The period of three years mentioned in subsection (5)(b) need not be continuous but
must not have begun more than five years before, or ended more than three months
before, the making of the application.
