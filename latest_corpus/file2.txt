Meaning of “parental responsibility”
 In this Act “parental responsibility” means all the rights, duties, powers,
responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the
child and his property.
) It also includes the rights, powers and duties which a guardian of the child’s estate
(appointed, before the commencement of section 5, to act generally) would have had
in relation to the child and his property.
) The rights referred to in subsection (2) include, in particular, the right of the guardian
to receive or recover in his own name, for the benefit of the child, property of whatever
description and wherever situated which the child is entitled to receive or recover.
The fact that a person has, or does not have, parental responsibility for a child shall
not affect—
(a) any obligation which he may have in relation to the child (such as a statutory
duty to maintain the child); or
(b) any rights which, in the event of the child’s death, he (or any other person)
may have in relation to the child’s property.
A person who—
(a) does not have parental responsibility for a particular child; but
(b) has care of the child,
may (subject to the provisions of this Act) do what is reasonable in all the
circumstances of the case for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the child’s
welfare.
Acquisition of parental responsibility by father
Where a child’s father and mother were not married to each other at the time of his
birth—
(a) the court may, on the application of the father, order that he shall have parental
responsibility for the child; or
(b) the father and mother may by agreement (“a parental responsibility
agreement”) provide for the father to have parental responsibility for the child.
 No parental responsibility agreement shall have effect for the purposes of this Act
unless—
(a) it is made in the form prescribed by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor;
and
(b) where regulations are made by the Lord Chancellor prescribing the manner
in which such agreements must be recorded, it is recorded in the prescribed
manner.
) Subject to section 12(4), an order under subsection (1)(a), or a parental responsibility
agreement, may only be brought to an end by an order of the court made on the
application—
(a) of any person who has parental responsibility for the child; or
(b) with leave of the court, of the child himself.
The court may only grant leave under subsection (3)(b) if it is satisfied that the child
has sufficient understanding to make the proposed application.
